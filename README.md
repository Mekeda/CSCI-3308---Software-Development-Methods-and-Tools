## 1. Description
* A website applications that enables users to browse and save movies to their profile, enabling dynamic pairing to other users with similar interests in movies.

## 2. Vision Statement 
* We want the user to have full access to the movie database with a variety of movies to select from. Easy implementation of pairing users together based on movie preferences.

## 3. Motivation 
* From experience with HTML/CSS, the development team is interested in combining past and future knowledge of website development to create a functional product that provides users a new 
method to explore and socialize between individuals with the same interests.

## 4. Risks
* None of our team members have coded a website before. We will all have to learn HTML/CSS/JSON languages and implement a database. 
* The team needs to find a suitable movie database API to pull movie information from and be able to save it with the associated database in their profile.
* Website hosting suitable for connecting to both databases we will be using.


## 5. Risk Mitigation Plan 
* To mitigate the risk of not knowing HTML/CSS/JSON, we will utilize online tutorials that teach us how to develop a website. 
* We will research MYSQL extensively to develop and maintain a functional database along with the movie database API.
* Our team members will use VirtualBox or similar software to be able to work on the website on their Windows computers.

## 7. Development Logistics 
Version Control: 
* Git, GitHub (repo: https://github.com/Sale3054/SwiftRepo3308)

Development Method: 
* Agile

Collaboration Tool: 
* Slack 

Proposed Architecture: 
* For the front-end, we will be using HTML/CSS/JSON to create the user interface and functionality of the website. 
* For the back-end, we will be using a movie database API to pull movie information from and then save the information to a personalized profile in the
database we develop for matching users together.
